          <p>Bach's mother died in 1694, and his father died eight months
            later.[6] Bach, 10, moved in with his oldest brother, Johann
            Christoph Bach (1671–1721), the organist at the Michaeliskirche in
            Ohrdruf, Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg.[15] There he studied, performed, and
            copied music, including his own brother's, despite being forbidden
            to do so because scores were so valuable and private and blank
            ledger paper of that type was costly.[16][17] He received valuable
            teaching from his brother, who instructed him on the clavichord.
            J.C. Bach exposed him to the works of great composers of the day,
            including South German composers such as Johann Pachelbel (under
            whom Johann Christoph had studied)[3] and Johann Jakob Froberger;
            North German composers;[4] Frenchmen, such as Jean-Baptiste Lully,
            Louis Marchand, Marin Marais; and the Italian clavierist Girolamo
            Frescobaldi. Also during this time, he was taught theology, Latin,
            Greek, French, and Italian at the local gymnasium.[18]</p>
          <br />
          <p>In 1708, Bach left Mühlhausen, returning to Weimar this time as
            organist and from 1714 "Konzertmeister", director of music, at the
            ducal court, where he had an opportunity to work with a large,
            well-funded contingent of professional musicians.[18] Bach moved
            with his family into an apartment very close to the ducal palace. In
            the following year, their first child was born and Maria Barbara's
            elder, unmarried sister joined them. She remained to help run the
            household until her death in 1729.</p>
